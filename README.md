# Vultur
VULTUR is an advanced system for monitoring and evaluating nighttime light pollution, designed to be deployed on various aerial platforms such as drones, helium balloons, and helicopters. This device enables the capture of high-resolution images at night, with the goal of identifying and characterizing artificial light sources that contribute to light pollution, an increasingly serious environmental problem in many regions of the world.
In the context of Chile, where light pollution has become a particularly critical concern due to the presence of some of the world’s most important astronomical observatories, VULTUR emerges as a key tool for monitoring artificial nighttime light. Recent lighting regulations in Chile, aimed at mitigating the impact of light pollution in sensitive areas such as the country’s northern region, require measurement systems that provide high precision and flexibility to address the spatial and spectral characteristics of artificial light in urban, rural, and observatory-adjacent areas.
VULTUR can play an integral role in assessing compliance with these regulations, providing precise, high-resolution data that make it possible to detect and geolocate light pollution sources, such as emissions in specific spectra (for example, the blue light from white LEDs). Moreover, its capability to be deployed from mobile aerial platforms makes it ideal for monitoring large areas and regions that are difficult to access, which is essential for the effective implementation of regulations across extensive territories.
